## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic functionality. The app uses simulated data for demonstration purposes.

### Customization

#### Adding New Stations

Edit `src/components/StationSearch.tsx` to add more German railway stations:

```typescript
const GERMAN_STATIONS: Station[] = [
  { id: '8000XXX', name: 'Your Station Name', city: 'City Name' },
  // ... existing stations
];
```

#### Modifying Train Types

Update train types and their characteristics in `src/services/dbApi.ts`:

```typescript
const TRAIN_TYPES = [
  { product: 'ice', productName: 'ICE', name: 'ICE', speed: 250 },
  // ... add your train types
];
```

## 📊 Data Sources

### Current Implementation

BahnPulse currently uses **simulated realistic data** that models:

- ✅ Accurate German railway station database (100+ major stations)
- ✅ Realistic journey times based on distance and train types
- ✅ Probabilistic delay modeling (30% chance of delays, realistic distributions)
- ✅ Proper train type selection (ICE for long distance, regional for shorter routes)
- ✅ Transfer logic for complex journeys
- ✅ Platform assignments and cancellation rates

### Future Integration Options

The architecture supports easy integration with:

- **Deutsche Bahn API** (`v6.db.transport.rest`)
- **GitHub Data Repository** ([deutsche-bahn-data](https://github.com/piebro/deutsche-bahn-data))
- **Real-time GTFS feeds**
- **Custom data sources**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### User Experience

- **Mobile-First**: Designed primarily for on-the-go usage
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed contextually
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time loading states and error handling
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

### Visual Design

- **Clean Interface**: Minimal clutter, focus on essential information
- **Consistent Typography**: Clear hierarchy with readable font sizes
- **Color Psychology**: Red for Deutsche Bahn branding, green for on-time, yellow/red for delays
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```
